-- Fix customer data exposure security issue
-- The existing SELECT policy has a potential gap for anonymous users

-- First, drop the existing SELECT policy to replace it with a more secure one
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Business owners can view their appointments" ON public.appointments;

-- Create a more secure SELECT policy that explicitly denies anonymous access
-- and ensures only authenticated business owners can view their appointments
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated business owners can view their appointments"

USING (

-- Additionally, let's add a policy to explicitly deny access to anonymous users
CREATE POLICY "Deny anonymous access to appointments" 
ON public.appointments

TO anon

-- Also improve the INSERT policy to be more secure by ensuring rate limiting
-- and preventing abuse while still allowing public appointment booking
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create appointments" ON public.appointments;

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create appointments" 
ON public.appointments

  customer_name IS NOT NULL

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated business owners can update their appointments"
