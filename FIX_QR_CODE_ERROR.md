# Fix: "Business Not Found" Error (QR Code & Booking Links)

## Problem
When customers scan QR codes or click booking links, they see:
- ‚ùå "Business not found" error
- ‚ùå HTTP 406 error in browser console
- ‚ùå Cannot access business landing page

## Root Cause
The Row Level Security (RLS) policy on the `businesses` table was too restrictive. It only allowed authenticated business owners to view their business data, blocking unauthenticated customers from viewing business profiles.

## Solution
Apply the migration file `20250102000001_fix_business_public_access.sql` to allow public read access to business profiles.

## üöÄ Quick Fix (Apply Migration)

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended - 2 minutes)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Open: https://app.supabase.com
   - Select your TimeLine project

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Click "+ New query"

3. **Paste the SQL**
   ```sql
   -- Fix RLS policy to allow public access to business profiles
   DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own business" ON public.businesses;

   CREATE POLICY "Public can view businesses"
     ON public.businesses
     FOR SELECT
     USING (true);
   ```

4. **Run the Query**
   - Click "Run" button (or press Ctrl+Enter)
   - You should see: "Success. No rows returned"

5. **Test Immediately**
   - Refresh your browser
   - Try the QR code/booking link again
   - Should work now! ‚úÖ

### Option 2: Using Migration File (Organized approach - 5 minutes)

If you want to keep this as a proper migration in your database history:

1. **The migration file already exists:**
   `supabase/migrations/20250102000001_fix_business_public_access.sql`

2. **Apply it in Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
   - Click "+ New query"
   - Open the file `supabase/migrations/20250102000001_fix_business_public_access.sql`
   - Copy the entire content
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click "Run"

3. **Verify Migration**
   - Go to Database ‚Üí Policies
   - Check that `public.businesses` has a policy named "Public can view businesses"

## ‚úÖ Verification

After applying the fix, test these scenarios:

### Test 1: QR Code/Business Link (Logged Out)
1. Log out of any business account (or use incognito window)
2. Scan QR code OR visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/b/{businessId}`
3. ‚úÖ Business landing page should load
4. ‚úÖ No "Business not found" error
5. ‚úÖ No console errors

### Test 2: Booking Flow
1. From business landing page, click "Book Appointment"
2. ‚úÖ Services should be visible
3. ‚úÖ Can select date and time
4. ‚úÖ Can complete booking

### Test 3: Business Dashboard (Security Check)
1. Log in as business owner
2. Go to dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Can still see and manage own business
4. ‚úÖ Cannot see other businesses (security maintained)

## üîí Security Notes

### What's Now Public ‚úÖ
- Business profiles (name, description, hours, contact info)
- Business services (name, price, duration)
- Public business landing pages
- QR code/booking link access

### What Remains Protected üîí
- **Creating businesses** - Only authenticated users
- **Updating businesses** - Only business owners
- **Deleting businesses** - Only business owners
- **Appointment data** - Protected by separate RLS policies
- **Customer private info** - Protected by separate RLS policies

This is the **correct security model** for a booking system:
- Business info should be publicly viewable (like a website)
- Only owners can modify their business
- Customer data remains private

## üìä Technical Details

### Before (Broken)
```sql
-- Too restrictive - blocks unauthenticated users
create policy "Users can view their own business"
  on public.businesses
  for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

**Problem:** `auth.uid()` is NULL for logged-out users, so the policy always fails.

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- Allows public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public can view businesses"
  ON public.businesses
  FOR SELECT
  USING (true);
```

**Solution:** `USING (true)` allows anyone to SELECT (read) business data.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: SQL query fails with "policy already exists"
**Solution:** The policy might already be named differently. Run:
```sql
-- Check existing policies
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'businesses';

-- If you see a different policy name, drop it first:
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "your-policy-name-here" ON public.businesses;

-- Then create the new one
CREATE POLICY "Public can view businesses"
  ON public.businesses FOR SELECT USING (true);
```

### Issue: Still getting "Business not found"
**Possible causes:**
1. **Migration not applied** - Check Database ‚Üí Policies in Supabase
2. **Wrong business ID** - Verify the ID in your database matches the URL
3. **No businesses exist** - Create a test business first
4. **Cache issue** - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### Issue: Can see business but services won't load
**Check:** Services table also needs public access policy (already added in migration `20250102000000_add_services_table.sql` line 42-46):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can view active services"
  ON public.services FOR SELECT
  USING (is_active = true);
```

## üìù Summary

**What to do:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. SQL Editor ‚Üí New query
3. Paste the SQL fix above
4. Run it
5. Test QR code - should work!

**Time:** 2 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy
**Risk:** None (only changes read permissions, not data)
